-- We're going to upgrade the capability of our AppM by generalising the type of the errors that
-- it handles. This means that we'll be able to reuse our 'AppM' in more places that maybe have an
-- overabundance of 'IO (Either e a)' types.
--
-- Our new 'AppM'' will also use the record syntax to define our 'runAppM' function. This is a more
-- common definition of this kind of newtype.
--
newtype AppM e a = AppM
  { runAppM :: IO (Either e a)
  }

-- Predominantly our application has only one error type: 'Error'. It would be tedious to have to
-- declare that on every signature. We're able to use a type _alias_ to avoid this problem. We can
-- define this type alias to make the error type variable concrete as 'Error'.
--
type App = AppM Error

-- We need to refactor the 'runAppM' function as now the name conflicts, and it needs to suit the
-- specialised 'App' type. The definition is even simpler than before. If someone near you is up to
-- the same section, try to explain to each other why this works.

-- You may copy your previously completed AppM instances here and then refactor them to suit the
